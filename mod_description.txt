[b]DIVINE LINK[/b] - a kinda small kinda strange Cruelty Squad inspired Difficulty/QOL mod

Adds 3 difficulties that take effect based off how many times you die, each with unique effects.
(also adds 1 secret harder difficulty)

This mod came to me in a dream and as such may not make a whole lot of sense at times.
However I can promise it is certainly a mod. For Noita.
